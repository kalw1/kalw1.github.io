  <h1>About Me</h1>
  <p>
Hi, I'm Kal.
I study Software Engineering at QUB, currently in my second year. My main language at the moment is Java, but it varies quite a lot. I enjoy coding, and try to do it whenever I find time.
One of my passions is basketball, specifically the NBA. In my eyes, basketball is the perfect mix of flashy athleticism and nerdy stat keeping. I'm a fan of the San Antonio Spurs, and my favourite player all time is Tim Duncan. 
I love movies, TV and games. My favourite movie is Interstellar, I think I've watched it 15 times. For TV shows, the best show I've ever watched is Dopesick, but one I keep going back to is Family Guy. My favourite game of all time is Terraria, I don't think that will ever change. One game I recommend to everyone though is Disco Elysium. There is simply nothing like it.
If you want to know more about anything or just chat, feel free to hit me up on any social media or my email.
Seeya!
