I created a very rudimental program to calculate crop profits in Stardew Valley.

I wanted to know the best crop to grow on specific days of the season e.g. if I only have 13 days left in the season, how much profit will each crop give me. Looking online, I saw no real website that would consider these conditions. It takes into account the current season and the date and displays a list of each crop name with a profit beside it. The program is very basic, and I might look to add more functionality in the future. I mainly did this to get some practice in Java after a break. 

You can find the code on my GitHub!
